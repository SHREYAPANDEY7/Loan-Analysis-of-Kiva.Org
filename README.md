## Project Motivation

The data is sourced from [Kiva.Org](http://kiva.org/) and represents the three prominent points of significance.
lenders, loans, and borrowers. This data was obtained firsthand. The study was focused on
identifying answers to a few descriptive and predictive questions. The study of the loan's dataset
was helpful to identify answers to our curiosity. The lenders data analysis equally came into play
where we tried to define the distribution of loans to members/borrowers of Kiva. **The basic
curiosity was to identify the way Kiva works, how loans are generated, how lenders are
funded and how the entire lending and borrowing over a digital platform works.**

Conducting analysis on the data using various data mining techniques, we intended to generate models that would accurately bring answers to our questions pre-defined on our proposal. An accurate study of the three datasets could answer and identify answers to the factors responsible for the expiration of loans, the propensity for lenders to contribute to the sectors, factors that are important for lenders to keep repeating the lending and so on. Secondary objectives were to find the distribution of loans according to gender, the average amount of loans generated, highest funded loans, the sector that has received the most bullet repayments and so on.
